I am currently a 3rd year Master student in the school of Computer and Communication Sciences at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). My interests includes research with LLM and the applications. I am also interested in developing games in my spare time.

Before EPFL, I received my B.Eng degree in Artificial Intelligence (with honors) at [Qian Xuesen Honors College](https://bjb.xjtu.edu.cn/) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in China. 

I am now doing my 6-months internship in [Oracle Switzerland](https://www.oracle.com/ch-de/) working on the LLM application in Database Systems. Previously, I did my internship in [Bosch China](https://www.bosch.com.cn/en/) (2023 summer) on Machine Learning with Embbeded Systems and in [Tecorigin](http://www.tecorigin.com/) (2022 spring) on GPU optimization.
